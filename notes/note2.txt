Chapter 4 Expressions and Operators

An expression is a phrase of JS that a JS interpreter can evaluate to produce a value.

The most common way to build a complex expression out of simpler expressoin is with operator.

1. Primiary Expressions

2. Object and Array Initializers

	Object and array initializers are expressions whose value is a newly created object or array

3. Function Definition Expressions

	A function definition expression defines a JS function, and the value of such an expressions is the newly defined function.

4. Property Access Expressions

	A property access expression ecaluates to the value of an object property or an array element.

	ex:

	//An example object
	var o = {

		x:1;

		y:{z:3}
	};    

	o.x 	//=>1

	o.y.z   // =>3

	o["x"]  //=>1

	//An example array that contains the object

	var a = [o,4,[5,6]];

	a[1] 	//=>4

	a[2]["1"] 	//=>6

	a[0].x	 //=>1

5. Invocation Expressions

	An invocation expression is JS's syntax for calling a function or a method.

	It starts wotj a function expression that identifies the functions to be called.

6. Object Creation Expressions

	An object creation expression creates a new object and invokes a function (called a constructor) to initialize the properties of that oject. 

	keyword: new

	EX:

	new Object()
	new Point(2,3)

7. Operator

8. Arithmetic Expressions

	1.) Unary Arithmetic Operators
	2.) Bitwise Operators

9. Relational Expressions

	1.) Equality and Inequality Operators
	2.) Comparsion Operators

10. Logical Expression.
	
	1.） Logical AND
	2.)  Logical OR
	3.)  Logical NOT

11. Assignment Expressions

12. Evaluation Expressions

	1.） eval()

	2.) Golbal eval()

13. Miscellaneous Operators

	1.) Conditional Operator (?:)

		ex:
		//absolute value of x
		x > 0 ? x : -x

		greeting  = "hello" + (username ? username : "there");

		//equivalent to, but more compact than:

		greeting = "hello";
		if(username)
			greeting += username;


	2.) typeof Operator

		details in page83

	3.) delete operator

	4.) void operator

		void is a unary operator that appears before its single operand, which may be of any type.
		This operator is unusual and infrequently used: it evaluates its operand, then discards the value and returns undefined.

	5.) Comma Operator(,)

		binary operator whose operands may be of any type.




Chapter 5  Statements

Statements are JS sentences or cmmands. 

Expressions are evaluated to produce a value, but statements are executed to make something happen.

1. Expression Statements

	EX: Assignments statements

2. Compound and Empty Statements

	Just as the comma operator combines multiple expressions into a single expression, a statement block combines multiple statements into a single compound statement. 

	Empty statements 

3. Declaration Statements

	The var and function are declaration statements, they declare or define variables and functions.

4. Conditionals 

	1.) if
	2.)else if
	3.)switch

5. loops

	1.)  while
	2.)  do/while
	3.)  for
	4.)  for/in
	
		ex:

		for(var i = 0; i < a.length; i++)

		// equivalent to 

		for(var p in o)

6. Jumps

	1.) break
	2.) continue
	3.) return
	4.) throw
	5.) try/catch/finally


7. Miscellaneous Statements

	1.) with
	2.) debugger (usually does nothing)
	3.) use strict
